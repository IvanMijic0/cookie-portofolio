It evokes both vulnerability and a desire for understanding in a world that feels unstable.

      "textThree": "In Pride and Prejudice, two hands pull in opposite directions—symbolizing pride, misjudgment, and the eventual reconciliation of two strong wills. Sense and Sensibility shows a woman reaching for a man who doesn’t hold her firmly, while another hand behind her does—highlighting the contrast between fleeting passion and steady love. In Emma, the heroine is depicted playing chess with real people, reflecting her well-meaning but misguided attempts at matchmaking.",
      "textFour": "Every piece is adorned with meaningful flowers, chosen to represent the characters and emotional tone of each story. The series blends visual storytelling and literary symbolism, offering a modern yet respectful homage to Austen’s timeless narratives."

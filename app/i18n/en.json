More than homage, these images are exercises in atmosphere — a study in light, shadow, and emotion, a window into the tension and elegance of 1940s cinema.",
    "text": "Every photograph was carefully lit and staged to mirror the original stills, not only in composition but in emotional texture. The light carves out character, echoing the moral ambiguity and elegance that define the genre — and the film."

      "textOne": "As a submission for the 2024 Kreativ Fest art direction at International Burch University, this visual identity proposal draws heavily from grunge aesthetics and the experimental legacy of David Carson.",
      "textTwo": "Centered around a custom logotype reading “Kreativ Euphoria,” the design uses negative-space lettering and a stamp-like composition to reflect the chaotic, expressive energy of young creatives.",
      "textThree": "The visual language is built on a contrast of vivid neon green, pink, and orange against stark black overlays, creating a dynamic, high-impact look that feels both nostalgic and fresh. The textures and layering mimic ripped posters and street art, reinforcing a raw, urban atmosphere.",
      "textFour": "Across posters, leaflets, and social media, the identity maintains a consistent, tactile quality while adapting to different formats.",
      "textFive": "This concept celebrates imperfection, spontaneity, and the power of student expression. It doesn’t just promote an event—it visually embodies its energy, reminding every viewer: you can be kreativ too."

    "text": {
      "textOne": "For the stage adaptation of Sjećaš li se Doli Bel at Kamerni Teatar 55 in Sarajevo, I reimagined the promotional visuals with a concept rooted in emotional symbolism and narrative depth.",
      "textTwo": "Drawing from the story’s themes of adolescence, loss, and emotional decay, I chose a vivid red background to reflect the intensity of the characters’ surroundings. In contrast, white handwritten typography symbolizes innocence that is gradually consumed by the world around it. The fragmented title layout forms a crooked house shape, referencing the confined and unstable spaces where much of the story takes place, from family homes to hotel rooms.",
      "textThree": "The handwritten typeface ties into the characters’ search for connection and learning, especially through the relationship between Doli and the protagonist. It evokes both vulnerability and a desire for understanding in a world that feels unstable. The accompanying brochure continues this narrative visually, with a circular, disoriented layout that mirrors the story’s emotional cycles and sense of imbalance. This identity captures the fragile, messy,  and deeply human essence of the play."

      "textTwo": "With a name full of personality, the visual identity needed to match, professional yet approachable, clean but expressive. The logo features a chipmunk wearing a beanie and glasses, cleverly formed in the negative space of a bold letter “C.”",
      "textThree": "This simple, rounded shape ensures versatility and strong brand recognition, while the character adds charm and uniqueness. The clean circular shape ensures versatility, while the simplified character design keeps it easily recognizable across applications.",
      "textFour": "A pastel green gradient brings a sense of freshness and calm professionalism. The result is a memorable, modern logo that stands out in the tech space with just the right balance of fun and clarity."

      "textThree": "Dressed in historically inspired garments with earthy tones and folk motifs, the fairy is crowned with wildflowers and adorned with horns, a nod to her mythological ability to transform into a white goat, her symbol. The warm forest backdrop echoes the mountainous terrain she is said to inhabit, blending realism and fantasy to root her firmly in her homeland.",
      "textFour": "This series was born from a desire to reconnect with Bosnia’s deeper cultural past—one that extends far beyond Ottoman or modern-day narratives. Much of the pre-imperial, pre-modern history of Bosnia remains overlooked or forgotten, and this project seeks to give it a new voice. Each character, aims to breathe life back into centuries-old legends, honoring the richness of a heritage that deserves to be seen, remembered, and reimagined."

      "textTwo": "Each piece captures the emotional core of its novel through symbolic compositions, framed like vintage cameos to evoke the era’s elegance and intimacy.",
      "textThree": "In Pride and Prejudice, two hands pull in opposite directions—symbolizing pride, misjudgment, and the eventual reconciliation of two strong wills. Sense and Sensibility shows a woman reaching for a man who doesn’t hold her firmly, while another hand behind her does—highlighting the contrast between fleeting passion and steady love. In Emma, the heroine is depicted playing chess with real people, reflecting her well-meaning but misguided attempts at matchmaking.",
      "textFour": "Every piece is adorned with meaningful flowers, chosen to represent the characters and emotional tone of each story. The series blends visual storytelling and literary symbolism, offering a modern yet respectful homage to Austen’s timeless narratives."

Pigeons, a recurring symbol of Sarajevo, traverse the scene as messengers of peace, movement, and connection—reinforcing Bosnia’s role as part of the wider European community. A bold yellow accent, taken from both the Bosnian flag and Europe House identity, ties the visual elements together into a cohesive narrative.",
      "textThree": "The lower part of the mural was intentionally kept minimal due to the placement of nearby seating, inviting viewers to sit, reflect, and embrace the shared values of unity, respect, and belonging."
